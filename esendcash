You may be disheartened in your search to receive traditional funding due to the horrible appearance of your credit file. There are loans for people with bad credit that are offered by lenders who know that a few mistakes on your credit file does not mean you cannot manage your credit, if given a second chance. In fact, there are several types of bad credit loans for you to choose from.

No Credit Check Bad Credit Loan

The most common type is a payday loan. It is a short term loan which is usually in the range of $300 to $1500. It is simple to get and requires no credit check. You simply present a postdated check in the amount you wish to borrow, plus fees, to your lender. The lender holds the check until your next payday, usually two weeks to one month away. This type of loan is the most popular because the only requirement to receive it is that you have a job and a bank account.
